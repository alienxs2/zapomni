## What Was Done

### Issue #23: RustExtractor

**Files Created:**
- `src/zapomni_core/treesitter/extractors/rust.py` (1324 lines)
- `tests/unit/treesitter/extractors/test_rust.py` (999 lines)

**Files Updated:**
- `src/zapomni_core/treesitter/config.py` - added "rust" to LANGUAGES_WITH_EXTRACTORS
- `src/zapomni_core/treesitter/extractors/__init__.py` - added RustExtractor exports

**Features Implemented:**
- Functions (fn) with parameters and return types
- impl blocks with method extraction
- self/&self/&mut self receiver detection
- Structs with field names and derive attributes
- Traits (as INTERFACE type) with method signatures
- Supertraits in bases list
- Enums with variant names and data variants
- Doc comments (/// style) extraction
- Visibility detection (pub, pub(crate), pub(super) vs private)
- Generics and lifetimes extraction
- Attributes (#[derive], #[cfg], etc.) as decorators
- Auto-registration in LanguageParserRegistry

**Tests:** 55 comprehensive tests (target was 50+)
